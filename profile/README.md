# AppHack

AppHack is a 24-hour student-run hackathon hosted at Appalachian State
University. At AppHack, teams of students get involved in the software
development process including design, development, and marketing disciplines.
In addition to being a highly productive environment, AppHack is loads of fun!

This GitHub organization holds the sources for the
[AppHack](https://apphack.dev) websites past and present.
